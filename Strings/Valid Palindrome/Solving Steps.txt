Valid Palindrome is the 25th problem on leetcode.

Problem Statement:
      A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.

  3. If the character is only alphanumeric then only push that character into string.
  
  4. Copy the string using another string.
  
  5. Reverse the copied string.
  
  6. Compare the reversed string with normal string.
  
  7. If it is same then return true.
  
  8. Otherwise it is false.
