Determine if String Halves Are Alike is the 1704th problem on leetcode.

Problem Statement:
      You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.

Steps to solve:
  1. Take two variables as v1 and v2 to count the vowels in both strings.
  
  2. Split the number of charecters in string.
  
  3. Iterate the first part of the string and update the value v1 if any vowels are found.
  
  4. Iterate the second part of the string and update the value v2 if any vowels are found.
  
  5. If the v1 is equal to v2 then return true otherwise return false.
