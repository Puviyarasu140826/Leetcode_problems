Here you can find the steps for solving "Majority Element" leetcode problem...

Majority Element is the 169th problem on leetcode.

Problem Statement:
      Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Steps to solve:
  1. Use boyere-moore algorithm for this problem.
  
  2. Create temp variable and store the first element of the array.
  
  3. Run the loop for traversing the array completely.
  
  4. If the temp value is equal to iterating values, then increase the count.
  
  5. Tf the iterating value is different, then decrease the count.
  
  6. If the count gets 0, then store the current value to temp variable and make cnt as 1.
  
  7. Return the final value of t.
