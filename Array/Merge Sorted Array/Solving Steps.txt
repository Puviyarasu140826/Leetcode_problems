Here you can find the steps for solving "Merge Sorted Array" leetcode problem...

Merge Sorted Array is the 88th problem on leetcode.

Problem Statement:
      You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Steps to solve:
  1. The first array having the array size of both the array element count.
  
  2. Assign one pointer to the last index of the first array.
  
  3. Copy the second array elements to the first array at the end.
  
  4. Sort the first array to get the desired output..
